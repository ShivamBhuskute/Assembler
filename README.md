# Assembler
A minimal 16-bit assembler for x86 assembly.

TODO: 
1. Documentation is yet to be done for project, ill probaably add a docker environment too so that anyone can test and edit easily
2. But for now it is mostly completed and can run 16-bit assembly and generate bin file(will add support for hex file soon).
3. Also optimization is yet to be done, many methods are crude and manual, I'll try for some optimizations in encoding or IR generation too.

Referring http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html#x88 for opcode and instruction set reference.
Also, John Donovan's systems programming book is used as a reference to create algorithms
